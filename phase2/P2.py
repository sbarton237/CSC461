"""
The Gibbs phenomenon is the name given to the oscillations observed in the fourier series of a periodic function newar to a step discontinuity. For example, the square wave defined by f(x) = 1 for 0<x<1 and f(x) = -1 for 1<x<2 and repeating outside the range(0, 2) has the Fourier series expansion:
f(x) = 4/pi * âˆ‘n=1, 3, 5,... 1/n*sin(npix)
Plot f(x) and its Fourier series expansion truncated at 20 terms on the same axes, (a) for 0<x<4 and (b) zoomed in on a region exhibition the Gibbs phenomenon.
