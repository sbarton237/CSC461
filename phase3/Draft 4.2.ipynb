The idea that an electron will move towards a positive charge and away from a negative charge might make sense, but it can be difficult to visualize where an electron might go in a more complicated field of charges. This project is about helping students in physics classes understand how electrons are moved in electric fields\n",

    "<p>The purpose of the Charge Object is to be able to make variables that can hold all of the parts of a charge. Simple variables, like ints and strings, can only hold one piece of information, and while lists can hold multiple pieces of information, they aren't consistent. All charges have the same types of information that they need to hold, so creating an Object is the simplest way to standardize charges.</p>\n",
    "<p>The first piece of information that a charge has is its position, where it is located on the graph. Since this model is only 2D, the position has only two parts, the x element and the y element. This could be held in a list or as two seperate floats, but I decided to have position be an ndarray for the abilities that ndarrays have for math. ndarray's function similarly to vectors, and can be added or subtracted while lists can't be. When two lists are added together, they get concatenated, but when two ndarrays of the same length are added or subtracted, a new ndarray is created where the elements in each ndarray are added or subtracted, which is useful since I'll need to find the distance between charges and the electron in the future (<em>The N-dimensional</em>, n.d.).</p>\n",

It has two underscores in front of and behind its name because it is what is known as a magic method. Magic methods are different than normal methods because they aren't meant to be called directly. Since an object doesn't exist until initialization, it has to be a magic method because you can't call a method on an object that doesn't exist yet. Beyond initialization, there are two methods for a Charge Object known as getter methods. The purpose of these methods is to \"get\" the variable that exist within an object. Here, there's a getter method for position and a getter method for charge. All these do is return the value of the position or charge of a Charge Object.</p>"

    "<p>Like for charges, I made an Electron Object to be able to hold all of the different parts of an electron. Unlike a charge, where everything is held constant throughout the simulation, an electron has a lot of things that are happening to it, and so needs more variable and more methods.</p>\n",
    "<p>First of all, there's more variables. Electron's also have position and charge (though all of them have a charge of -e), but since they are moving they also have a velocity and acceleration. These are both initially [0, 0] (using ndarrays because velocity and acceleration are both 2D vectors in a 2D space), as before the model starts the electron has no forces on it and does not start out moving.</p>\n",
    "<p>Electron's also have getter methods, but they only have them for position, velocity, and acceleration, because it can be assumed that every electron has a charge of -e so it is unnecessary to have a way to access the charge of the electron outside of the Electron Object.</p>\n",
    "<p>The most important method that an electron has is <em>get_force(self, charges)</em>. This method calculates the force on the electron at it's current position. It takes in a list of all of the charges the are on the graph. Starting with force=[0, 0], the force of each individual charge on the electron is calculated and added to the force to end up with the total force. The force is calculated with Coulmob's Law:</p>\n",

    "    F=\\frac{q_1*q_2}{4\\pi*e_0}*\\frac{r_1-r_2}{|r_1-r_2|^3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "<p>Once the total force is calculated, acceleration can be found using Newton's Second Law ($F=ma$). For the purposes of the model, I slightly adjust the acceleration by dividing by an additional 100 so the acceleration is smaller than found. This is because using the actual acceleration results in the model failing due to consistent overshooting of position. Since force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the electron and a charge, once the electron gets too far away it will never course correct back to where it should end up. As large movements make it easy for the model to mess up, I've added in the adjustment to increase accuracy.</p>\n",
    "<p>Finally, there are methods to update the velocity and the position. Velocity is the area under the curve of acceleration, so when integration isn't desirable, velocity can be found through adding up all of the accelerations from start to finish. So, whenever velocity needs to be updated, acceleration is added to the current velocity. This same process works for position, as position is the area under the curve of velocity.</p>"

    "<p>Generator functions have multiple purposes, but for my model, I need it in order to control my model. There are two main methods for determining how many frames an animation will run. The first is to hard code a number of frames, but that's not going to work for this model. The second method is to use a generator function. With a generator function, the animation will run until it stops yielding (returning) numbers (ImportanceOfBeingErnest, 2018). Since I want the model to stop updating and be complete under certain circumstances, a generator function is the best way for me to determine how many frames I want the model to run for.</p>\n",
    "<p>There's three possible stop conditions for when I want the model to end. The first is if the elecetron is touching a charge, which should only happen with a positive charge. Since the distance between charges will be so small at that point, the force of that one charge will overwhelm every other force and the electron will stay on that charge. My code can't understand that though, and would slingshot my electron out if I didn't stop the model. So, if the electron tooks a charge, the animation will stop. There's some range allowed because it's highly unlikely that the electron will ever have the exact same position as a charge.</p>\n",

    "<p>In order to make the main body of code more organized, I made a function to create the model, despite it only happening once. The function just takes in the charges and the electron so it can access all of them when creating the model.</p>\n",
    "<p>The first thing I needed to go was set up the original graph. The first thing you always need to do when plotting is create a figure (typically fig) and axes (typically ax). The figure is where the graph is being drawn, while the axes are each individual subplot on the figure. Since I only need one plot for the model, everything just happens on the one set of axes (<em>Matplotlib.pyplot.subplots</em>, n.d.). Next, I plot the position of all of the charges and the starting position for the electron. I plot the position of the positive charges and negative charges seperately so that they can be different colors, making it easier for users to undertand the model. The way I do this is by creating a list by indexing through all of the elements of the charges list, and adding it to the list if it the type of charge I want. Then, since I decided that my graph would be (-100, 100) by (-100, 100), I set those to be the limits for the x and y coordinates. Finally, I made the legend visible so users would know which colors indicated which type of objects.</p>\n",
    "<p>The next part is the update function, which is used for updating the animation for the model. Update functions for FuncAnimation are required to take \"frame\" as a parameter, so it does so (<em>Matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation</em>, n.d.). When it's time to update to the next frame, this function is called. All it does is call <em>electron_update(charges, electron)</em>, update the position of the electron on the scatter plot by using <em>.set_offsets()</em>, which will move points on a scatter plot. Finally, it return the scatter plot so that the updated one is the one now in use.</p>\n",
    "<p>After that is creating the animation. Before the animation is created, I call <em>electron.get_force(charge)</em> so that the initial acceleration isn't [0, 0] and the model immediately stops. Once that is done, the animation is created with FuncAnimation. There's a couple of parts to that. First, it needs a figure where the animation is happening, and that's fig. Then, it needs a function that will be used for getting the next frame in the animation, that's my update function. Next is frames, which gets how many frames there are, this is where the generator function from before comes into use. After that is interval, which is set to 10, so when the animation runs there's 10 milliseconds between when frames switch. Finally, save_count is a backup for if the generator fails.</p>\n",
    "<p>Once the animation is created, I close the plot so it doesn't immediately pop up, as only one frame will pop up if the plot is shown without pushing it to the frontend. That's why what is return is <em>HTML(anim.to_jshtml())</em>, which basically turns the animation into something that can be read through HTML and shown on the frontend, where the user is.</p>"

That number is used as the range for a loop, where each time the loop goes through, another charge is created. In this loop, x position, y position, and charge are all asked for. Taking the information given, a new Charge Object is created and added to a list of charges for that model.</p>\n",
